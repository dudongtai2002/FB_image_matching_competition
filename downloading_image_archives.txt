HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE FB ISC IMAGE DATASETS
-----------------------------------------

Welcome to the FB Image Similarity Challenge! These instructions will help you get access to the image files you'll need to participate in the competition. 

As you know, there are 3 main archives of images:

    - query images
    - reference images
    - training images


The image archives for the competition are hosted on a public AWS S3 bucket in the following locations. 

	dataset          |         n |  size | s3_uri               
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	query images     |    50,000 |   7GB | s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/query_images/
	reference images | 1,000,000 | 178GB | s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/reference_images/
	training images  | 1,000,000 | 175GB | s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/training_images/

An additional set of 50,000 query images will be made available in Phase 2.

#### Regional buckets

The bucket listed above is in the US West AWS Region. Additional AWS buckets that may provide better download times for participants outside the US are also available in the EU (Frankfurt) and Asia (Singapore).

To access these buckets instead of the default US West bucket, simply append "-asia" or "-eu" to the end of the bucket name. So for the query images, rather than "s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/query_images/", you would use one of the following:

    s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data-asia/all/query_images/
    s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data-eu/all/query_images/


#### AWS CLI

The best way to access the data is by using the AWS CLI:

	https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

To download an individual image file to your machine, you can do the following. Note that you may or may not need the "--no-sign-request" flag depending on whether you have an AWS profile configured.

	aws s3 cp s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/query_images/Q00123.jpg ./ --no-sign-request

It's more likely that you'll want to download some or all of the images at once. For example, to download all of the query images, you would use the `--recursive` flag:

	aws s3 cp s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/query_images/ ./ --recursive --no-sign-request

You can also download just a subset of the image files using the `--exclude` and `--include` flags. For example, to download the first 1,000 images in the query set you could do:

	aws s3 cp s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/query_images/ ./ --recursive --exclude="*" --include="Q00*" --no-sign-request

To get the next 1,000 (Q01000.jpg to Q01999.jpg), you could do:

	aws s3 cp s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/query_images/ ./ --recursive --exclude="*" --include="Q01*" --no-sign-request

See the docs for more details on the use of filters and other flags:

	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/#use-of-exclude-and-include-filters


#### Metadata file

We have also provided csv files with image metadata on the competition "Data Download" page that may be useful if you want to write a script for downloading, or if you want to verify the integrity of your downloaded images by their MD5 checksum. The metadata files look like this:

	image_id | s3_uri                                                              | md5_checksum
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Q00000   | s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/query_images/Q00000.jpg | de21a560619005c56dcbd3a7e6c00fd9
	Q00001   | s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/query_images/Q00001.jpg | 7a68c7f40674a463d14d74c8f8033cc7
	Q00002   | s3://drivendata-competition-fb-isc-data/all/query_images/Q00002.jpg | 2005093a0ca9b1a33194561b219a0c49
